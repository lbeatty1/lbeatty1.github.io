I am a Highmeadows Postdoctoral Fellow at the Environmental Defense Fund.  I do research at the intersection of environmental economics and empirical industrial organization, with a particular interest in studying policy options to reduce emissions from oil and gas production.  I received my PhD in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the University of Maryland.
